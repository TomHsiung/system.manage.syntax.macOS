# Generate a key pair
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "name@domain.com"

# Add the private key to the ssh-agent
ssh-add --apple-use-keychain ~/.ssh/privkey.pem

# Copy public key and paste it to Github
# Pay attention: to use the native ssh-agent of macOS, third-party ssh-agents need to be turned off, e.g., 1Password.
